  <h1>Groundog Day in Punxatawney, PA</h1>

 <div class="one"> <p id="info">On February 2 each year, Punxsutawney holds a civic festival with music and food. During the ceremony, which begins well before the winter sunrise, <span class="phil">Phil</span>emerges from his temporary home on Gobbler's Knob, located in a rural area about 2 miles (3 km) southeast of the town. According to the tradition, if <span class="phil">Phil</span> sees his shadow and returns to his hole, he has predicted six more weeks of winter-like weather. If <span class="phil">Phil</span> does not see his shadow, he has predicted an "early spring."</p>

 <div class="two"> <p id="ceremony">The event is organized by the "Inner Circle" recognizable by their top hats and tuxedos who communicate with <span class="phil">Phil</span> to receive his prediction. The vice president of the Inner Circle prepares two scrolls in advance of the actual ceremony, one proclaiming six more weeks of winter and one proclaiming an early spring. At daybreak on February 2, <span class="phil">Punxsutawney Phil</span> awakens from his burrow on Gobbler's Knob, is helped to the top of the stump by his handlers, and explains to the president of the Inner Circle, in a language known as "Groundhogese", whether he has seen his shadow. The president of the Inner Circle, the only person able to understand Groundhogese through his possession of an ancient acacia wood cane, then interprets <span class="phil">Phil's</span> message, and directs the vice president to read the proper scroll to the crowd gathered on Gobbler's Knob and the masses of "phaithphil phollowers" tuned in to live broadcasts around the world.</p>

<div class="three"><p id="history">According to the lore, there is only one <span class="phil">Phil</span>, and all other weather-predicting groundhogs are impostors. It is claimed that this one groundhog has lived to make weather prognostications since 1886, sustained by drinks of "groundhog punch" or "elixir of life" administered at the annual Groundhog Picnic in the fall. The Groundhog Day celebration is rooted in Germanic tradition that says that if a hibernating animal casts a shadow on February 2, the Christian celebration of Candlemas, winter and cold weather will last another six weeks. If no shadow is seen, legend says, spring will come early. In Germany, the tradition evolved into a myth that if the sun came out on Candlemas, a hedgehog would cast its shadow, predicting snow all the way into May. When German immigrants settled in Pennsylvania, they transferred the tradition onto local fauna, replacing hedgehogs with groundhogs. Several other towns in the region hold similar Groundhog Day events. <span class=phil>Phil</span> first received his name in 1961. The origins of the name are unclear, but speculation suggests that it may have been indirectly named after Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.</p>

<div class="conclusion"><h2>What Groundhog Day Means To Me</h2> <br>
<p id="stuff">Groundhog Day is a time of magic and wonder. In a time of the year when the sun sets early and it's cold all the time, February second feels like a light in the darkness of winter. Though <span class="phil">Phil</span> may not know why he emerges from his home on to a stage in front of hundreds of people, he knows he has a job to do. He knows he is loved by the people watching and by the men in the weird hats surrounding him. He knows he likes to eat carrots and other vegetables. And even though <span class="phil">Phil's</span> predictions are statistically only right about fifty percent of the time, we still listen. We still care, year after year. And no matter how cynical you may be, how ridiculous you find it that a mid-sized rodent can predict the weather, some part of you will always believe him too.</p>
